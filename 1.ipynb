He buys 2 cans of 3 balls each.\\nOutput (CoT):\\n  1. Roger started with 5 balls.          ← 4 tokens\\n  2. Two cans × 3 balls = 6 balls.       ← 11 tokens\\n  3. 5 + 6 = 11.                         ← 5 tokens\\n  4. Answer: 11.                         ← final token\\n```\\n\\n*Key nuance:* The model **generates the reasoning** itself once the pattern is demonstrated.\\n\\n### 3.3  Why It Works  \\n\\n| Insight | Detail |\\n|---------|--------|\\n| **Rationales bridge gaps** | Natural language “rationals” provide a *semantic scaffold* that aligns model activations with logical steps. |\\n| **No architectural change** | Only the prompt changes; the underlying model stays identical. |\\n| **Few‑shot prompting** | 10‑20 demonstration pairs are enough for the model to internalize the reasoning pattern. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4️⃣  **Few‑Shot vs. Zero‑Shot CoT**  \\n\\n| Feature | Few‑Shot CoT | Zero‑Shot CoT |\\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\\n| **Prompt content** | Input‑Output pairs **with** explicit reasoning steps. | No examples; only a cue like “Let’s think step‑by‑step.” |\\n| **Cognitive load on model** | Must match the *format* of the examples (structure, token count). | Must *self‑generate* a reasoning chain from the cue alone. |\\n| **Typical performance** | Often higher on very large models because they can copy the demonstrated style. | Slightly lower but still improves over vanilla prompting; easier to deploy. |\\n| **Implementation cost** | Requires curating demonstration set. | Minimal overhead – just a short instruction. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5️⃣  Comparative Experiments (Hands‑On Lens)\\n\\n### 5.1  Project\\u202f1 – *Model‑Size × CoT Effect*  \\n- **Goal:** Empirically verify that CoT only shines on sufficiently large models.  \\n- **Setup:**  \\n  - Datasets: GSM‑8K (arithmetic), logical/symbolic reasoning sets.  \\n  - Models: FLAN‑T5‑small (80\\u202fM), FLAN‑T5‑base, FLAN‑T5‑large, LLaMA‑52\\u202fB, LLaMA‑7\\u202fB, TinyLlama‑1.1\\u202fB.  \\n  - Evaluation function: `is_correct(answer, ground_truth)`.  \\n- **Findings (in lecture):**  \\n  - Accuracy ≈ 0–5\\u202f% for all models ≤ 7\\u202fB with CoT.  \\n  - Accuracy climbs sharply only beyond ~50\\u202fB parameters.  \\n  - Matches paper’s claim: *Chain‑of‑Thought is an emergent ability of model scaling*.  \\n\\n### 5.2  Project\\u202f2 – *Three Prompting Strategies*  \\n- **Baselines:**  \\n  1. **Vanilla Few‑Shot** (direct answer).  \\n  2. **Few‑Shot CoT** (explicit steps).  \\n  3. **Zero‑Shot CoT** (“Let’s think step‑by‑step”).  \\n- **Models Tested:** FLAN‑52\\u202fB & LLaMA‑7\\u202fB.  \\n- **Tasks:** Logical puzzles, symbolic flips, simple commonsense questions.  \\n- **Result Summary:**  \\n  - Zero‑Shot CoT outperforms both baselines (≈20\\u202f% → 0\\u202f% vanilla).  \\n  - Few‑Shot CoT remains superior when enough demonstrations are provided.  \\n  - Demonstrates that *a single cue* (“think step‑by‑step”) can unlock reasoning without curated examples.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6️⃣  **Key Takeaways – The Owl’s Nuggets**  \\n\\n| **Takeaway** | **Explanation (Owl‑Style)** |\\n|--------------|-----------------------------|\\n| **Reasoning is a scaling phenomenon** | Like a fledgling eventually learning to soar, only the biggest brains can reliably follow multi‑step reasoning when prompted. |\\n| **Inference‑time compute ≠ training cost** | You don’t need to retrain; you simply spend more “thinking time” (tokens) at inference, which mobilizes latent reasoning pathways. |\\n| **Chain‑of‑Thought is prompt engineering, not architecture** | The model’s *knowledge* stays the same; the *behaviour* emerges from how you frame the question. |\\n| **Zero‑Shot CoT is a low‑friction entry point** | Just add “Let’s think step‑by‑step” – cheap, universal, works even without demonstration examples. |\\n| **Empirical gains are robust across domains** | Arithmetic, common‑sense, and symbolic tasks all benefit, though the magnitude varies (bigger for logical puzzles, modest for simple commonsense). |\\n| **Model size matters, but prompt design matters more** | A modest cue can unlock massive performance jumps if the model is large enough; conversely, even a large model may flounder with a poorly phrased prompt. |\\n| **Practical implication** | For production, you can often avoid fine‑tuning: just switch to CoT/Zero‑Shot CoT prompts and allocate a modest compute budget at inference. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7️⃣  **Suggested Reading Path (Owl‑Guided Bibliography)**  \\n\\n1. **\"Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models\"** – Google Brain, 2022.  \\n2. **\"Solving NLP Tasks with Zero‑Shot CoT\"** – Wei et\\u202fal., 2022 (arXiv).  \\n3. **\"Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models\"** – Kaplan et\\u202fal., 2020 (parameter‑vs‑performance trends).  \\n4. **\"Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models\"** – Wei, Lee, et\\u202fal., 2022.  \\n5. **Hands‑On Colab notebooks** – shared during lecture (install `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate`;

      "| **Chain‑of‑Thought is prompt engineering, not architecture** | The model’s *knowledge* stays the same; the *behaviour* emerges from how you frame the question. |\n",
      "| **Zero‑Shot CoT is a low‑friction entry point** | Just add “Let’s think step‑by‑step” – cheap, universal, works even without demonstration examples. |\n",
      "| **Empirical gains are robust across domains** | Arithmetic, common‑sense, and symbolic tasks all benefit, though the magnitude varies (bigger for logical puzzles, modest for simple commonsense). |\n",
      "| **Model size matters, but prompt design matters more** | A modest cue can unlock massive performance jumps if the model is large enough; conversely, even a large model may flounder with a poorly phrased prompt. |\n",
      "| **Practical implication** | For production, you can often avoid fine‑tuning: just switch to CoT/Zero‑Shot CoT prompts and allocate a modest compute budget at inference. |\n",

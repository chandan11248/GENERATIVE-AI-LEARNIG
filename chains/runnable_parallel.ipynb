      "{'pokhara': 'Pokhara is Nepal’s second-most visited city and the country’s adventure-leisure capital, sitting 200 km west of Kathmandu at an altitude of 800 m. A 25-minute flight (or 6–8 hour drive) from the capital brings you to a valley that is half-Tibetan plateau, half-subtropical lake district, with the Annapurna massif rising almost 7,000 m above the valley floor—one of the steepest elevation gains on earth.\\n\\n1. Geography & Setting  \\n   • Phewa (Fewa) Lake, the second-largest lake in Nepal, forms the city’s heart. On clear mornings the reflection of Machhapuchhare (“Fishtail”) peak is postcard-perfect.  \\n   • The Seti Gandaki river has carved a 100-m-deep limestone gorge that you can walk across on suspension bridges in minutes.  \\n   • Three other smaller lakes—Begnas, Rupa and Dipang—lie 15 km east, surrounded by rice terraces and forest.\\n\\n2. What to Do  \\n   Trekking & Mountains  \\n   • Annapurna Base Camp, Mardi Himal, Khopra Danda, and the classic 18-day Annapurna Circuit all start or finish here.  \\n   • 2- to 4-day “mini-circuits” (Australian Camp–Dhampus, Sarangkot–Naudanda) give families big-mountain views without altitude issues.\\n\\nAdventure Sports  \\n   • Paragliding: Sarangkot (1,600 m) is ranked one of the world’s top commercial sites; thermals lift you to 3,000 m with eagles and Himalayan griffons.  \\n   • Ultralight flights: 15–90 min “sky-tours” that fly you eye-level with 8,000 m peaks.  \\n   • White-water rafting on the Upper Seti (grade III-IV) or Trishuli (grade II-III) half-day trips.  \\n   • Zip-flyer (1.8 km, 100 mph), bungee into a tropical gorge, and recently opened high-rope canyoning in nearby canyons.\\n\\nCultural & Chill  \\n   • World Peace Pagoda (Shanti Stupa): 45-min hike or kayak + walk; 360° sunrise view.  \\n   • Old Pokhara (Bhairabsthan, Bhimsen Temple) and the Gurung, Magar and Thakali neighborhoods—stone-flag lanes, Newari brickwork, Tibetan refugee camps with carpet and thangka workshops.  \\n   • International Mountain Museum—comprehensive Nepal climbing history, Herzog’s 1950 Annapurna expedition gear, Yeti exhibit.  \\n   • Evening lakeside cafés: live folk-rock, open-mic, microbreweries, Tibetan momos, and locally grown coffee.\\n\\n3. When to Go  \\n   • Oct–Nov (post-monsoon, clearest skies) and Mar–Apr (rhododendron bloom) are prime.  \\n   • Dec–Feb: cold but crystal-clear; hotel prices drop 30–50 %.  \\n   • May is hot & hazy; Jun–Sep is monsoon—lush, leechy, but waterfalls everywhere and almost no tourists.\\n\\n4. Where to Stay  \\n   Lakeside (Baidam) is the tourist strip—everything from $6 dorms to $400-a-night spa resorts.  \\n   quieter North Lakeside or Phewa–Begnas road for homestays and organic farms.  \\n   Budget tip: rent a bicycle ($3/day) and stay 3 km south of Lakeside in Sedi or Khahare; same view, half the price.\\n\\n5. Food  \\n   • Must-tries: fresh-caught til-fry from Phewa, jimbu-himali-timur dal, gundruk ko achar, sel-roti with local honey, and apple-brandy from nearby Mustang.  \\n   • Lakeside’s lane 6 has Israeli falafel, Korean bibimbap, and Italian wood-fired pizza within 50 m—reflection of the global backpacker trail.\\n\\n6. Transport  \\n   • Tourist bus ($8–12) or micro-flight ($95–120) Kathmandu–Pokhara.  \\n   • Local buses to trailheads: Nayapul (1 h), Kande (45 min), Jomsom (8 h by jeep or 20 min flight).  \\n   • Scooter rental $6/day; e-bikes now available—valley loop is 65 km with 1,200 m of climbing.\\n\\n7. Responsible Travel  \\n   • Carry a SteriPEN or filter bottle—plastic bottles are the valley’s biggest waste headache.  \\n   • Choose lodge-based treks that use kerosene/gas, not firewood.  \\n   • Respect the “no drone” zone around the peace pagoda and in ACAP areas.\\n\\nBottom line: Pokhara is where you come to wash off the Kathmandu dust, stare at 8,000-metre peaks reflected in a placid lake, and decide whether tomorrow you’ll glide through the sky, paddle a kayak, or trek into some of the planet’s most iconic mountains.', 'kathmandu': \"Kathmandu is the capital and largest city of Nepal, a country in South Asia. It's located in the Kathmandu Valley, which is surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. The city is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and deep spiritual significance.\\n\\nHere are some key highlights:\\n\\n### 1. **Cultural and Historical Significance**\\nKathmandu has been a center of culture, religion, and trade for centuries.

Temples and stupas are scattered throughout the city, and religious festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm.\\n\\n### 3. **Urban Challenges**\\nRapid urbanization has led to issues like traffic congestion, air pollution, and infrastructure strain. Despite these challenges, Kathmandu remains a vibrant city with a strong sense of identity and resilience.\\n\\n### 4. **Tourism**\\nTourism is a major part of Kathmandu's economy. The city attracts travelers interested in trekking, cultural heritage, and spiritual experiences. It's also the gateway to the Himalayas, including Mount Everest.\\n\\n### 5. **Earthquake Impact**\\nIn 2015, a devastating earthquake caused significant damage to the city’s historic sites and infrastructure. Reconstruction efforts have been ongoing, with many landmarks restored or in the process of being rebuilt.\\n\\nWould you like more details on any specific aspect—like food, festivals, or travel tips?\"}\n"

      "Here is a 5-pointer summary of the report on unemployment in India:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **High Unemployment Rate**: The unemployment rate in India stands at 7.2% (2022-23), higher than the global average of 5.2%, with the youth (15-29 years) facing the highest unemployment rate of 12.4%.\n",
      "2. **Causes of Unemployment**: The key causes of unemployment in India include demographic dividend, lack of job creation, slowdown in economic growth, skills mismatch, and agricultural distress, which have led to a significant increase in rural unemployment.\n",
      "3. **Consequences of Unemployment**: The high unemployment rate in India has severe consequences, including poverty and inequality, social unrest, brain drain, and negative impact on economic growth, affecting not only individuals but also the overall economy.\n",
      "4. **Potential Solutions**: To address the issue of unemployment, the government and stakeholders can consider investing in education and skills training, promoting job creation, encouraging entrepreneurship, and implementing social security programs, such as unemployment insurance.\n",
      "5. **Recommendations for Future Action**: The report recommends developing a comprehensive employment policy, investing in education and skills training, encouraging entrepreneurship, promoting agricultural development, and implementing social security programs to reduce the unemployment rate and create a more prosperous and equitable society in India.\n",

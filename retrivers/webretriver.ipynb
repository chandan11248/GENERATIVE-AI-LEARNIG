    "## 1. Wikipedia Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieves documents directly from Wikipedia based on a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_community.retrievers import WikipediaRetriever\n",
    "\n",
    "retriever = WikipediaRetriever(top_k_results=2, lang=\"en\")\n",
    "query = \"the geopolitical history of india and pakistan from the perspective of a chinese\"\n",
    "docs = retriever.invoke(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Parameters:**\n",
    "- `top_k_results`: Number of Wikipedia articles to retrieve\n",
    "- `lang`: Language of Wikipedia to search\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Vector Store Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.documents import Document\n",
    "from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n",
    "from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\n",

    "# Create embeddings and vector store\n",
    "embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n",
    "vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(documents=docs, embedding=embedding)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever with MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(\n",
    "    search_type=\"mmr\",\n",
    "    search_kwargs={\"k\": 3, \"lambda_mult\": 0.5}\n",
    ")\n",

    "## 3. MultiQuery Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Generates multiple query variations using an LLM to improve retrieval coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever\n",
    "from langchain_groq import ChatGroq\n",
    "\n",
    "model = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")\n",

    "    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 5}),\n",
    "    llm=model\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "results = multiquery_retriever.invoke(\"How to improve energy levels?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Takes the original query\n",
    "2. Uses LLM to generate multiple query variations\n",
    "3. Retrieves documents for each variation\n",
    "4. Combines and deduplicates results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Contextual Compression Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Compresses retrieved documents to extract only the relevant portions.\n",

    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "results = compression_retriever.invoke(\"What is photosynthesis?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Retrieves documents using base retriever\n",
    "2. Uses LLM to extract only query-relevant content\n",
    "3. Returns compressed documents with focused content\n",
    "\n",

      "India, officially the Republic of India, has full diplomatic relations with 201 states, including Palestine, the Holy See, Niue and the Cook Islands. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is the government agency responsible for the conduct of foreign relations of India. With the world's third largest military expenditure, second largest armed force, fourth largest economy by GDP nominal rates and third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, India is a prominent regional power and a potential superpower.\n",
      "According to the MEA, the main purposes of Indian diplomacy include protecting India's national interests, promoting friendly relations with other states, and providing consular services to \"foreigners and Indian nationals abroad.\" In recent decades, India has pursued an expansive foreign policy, including the neighborhood-first policy embodied by SAARC as well as the Look East policy to forge more extensive economic and strategic relationships with East and Southeast Asian countries. It has also maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity, which involves its \"no first use\" nuclear policy and its neutral stance on the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n",
      "India is a member of several intergovernmental organisations, such as the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank, BRICS, and the G-20, which is widely considered the main economic locus of emerging and developed nations. India exerts a salient influence as the founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement. India has also played an important and influential role in other international organisations, such as the East Asia Summit, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund (IMF), G8+5 and IBSA Dialogue Forum. India is also a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. As a former British colony, India is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and continues to maintain relationships with other Commonwealth countries.\n",

      "\n",
      "India's relations with the world have evolved since the British Raj (1857–1947) when the British Empire took responsibility for handling external and defence relations. When India gained independence in 1947, few Indians had experience in making or conducting foreign policy. However, the country's oldest political party, the Indian National Congress, had established a small foreign department in 1925 to make overseas contacts and to publicise its independence struggle. From the late 1920s on, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had a long-standing interest in world affairs among independence leaders, formulated the Congress's stance on international issues in tandem with V. K. Krishna Menon; after 1947, they articulated India's worldview as Prime Minister and de facto Foreign Minister.\n",
      "India's international influence varied over the years after independence. Indian prestige and moral authority were high in the 1950s and facilitated the acquisition of developmental assistance from both East and West. Although the prestige stemmed from India's nonaligned stance, and in particular the position it placed Indian diplomats, like Menon, to mediate or conciliate in others' disputes, the nation was unable to prevent Cold War politics from becoming intertwined with interstate relations in South Asia.  On the intensely debated Kashmir issue with Pakistan, India lost credibility by rejecting United Nations' calls for a plebiscite in the disputed area.\n",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s, India's international position among developed and developing countries faded during wars with China and Pakistan, disputes with other countries in South Asia, and India's attempt to match Pakistan's support from the United States and China by signing the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in August 1971. Although India obtained substantial Soviet military and economic aid, which helped to strengthen the nation, India's influence was undercut regionally and internationally by the perception that its friendship with the Soviet Union...\n",

      "The United States has been providing military aid and economic assistance to Pakistan for various purposes since 1948. In 2017, the U.S. stopped military aid to Pakistan, which was about US$2 billion per year. With U.S. military assistance suspended in 2018 and civilian aid reduced to about $300 million for 2022, Pakistani authorities have turned to other countries for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "From 1947 to 1958, under civilian leadership, the United States provided Pakistan with modest economic aid and limited military assistance. During this period, Pakistan became a member of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), after a Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement signed in May 1954, which facilitated increased levels of both economic and military aid from the U.S.\n",
      "In 1958, Ayub Khan led Pakistan's first military coup, becoming Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and later President until 1969. During his tenure, the U.S. delivered substantial economic and military aid, despite Pakistan's governance by military regime, and amidst events like the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965.\n",
      "Yahya Khan succeeded Ayub in 1969, holding power during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 which led to the secession of East Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh. Under Yahya, the U.S. provided adequate economic but minimal military aid.\n",
      "Civilian governance of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto resumed from 1971 to 1977, during which the U.S. offered modest economic support and withheld military aid as Pakistan finalized its constitution, establishing a parliamentary democracy.\n",
      "Following another military coup in 1977, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq led the country. In April 1979, President Jimmy Carter halted all aid, excluding food assistance, due to Pakistan's efforts to establish a uranium enrichment facility, following Symington Amendment. Initial U.S. aid was limited, increasing significantly after geopolitical shifts such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the fall of the Shah of Iran. U.S. sanctions imposed in April 1979 due to Pakistan's nuclear activities were lifted by the end of the year in light of these events.\n",
      "Between 1988 and 1999, under civilian and democratic governments, U.S. aid was low, particularly after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. The aid was suspended in the 1990s under President George H. W. Bush, who cited concerns over Pakistan's developing nuclear program. Relations between the two countries deteriorated as the U.S. implemented the Pressler Amendment. This amendment led to severe sanctions against Pakistan, exacerbating economic challenges for the country's nascent civilian government. Consequently, all forms of bilateral aid from the U.S. to Pakistan were halted. The once expansive operations of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pakistan, which had employed over 1,000 staff across the country, were dramatically reduced almost overnight. Further complications arose from U.S. sanctions following Pakistan's nuclear tests in 1998, which were conducted in response to similar tests by India.\n",
      "The return of military rule under Pervez Musharraf from 1999 to 2008 initially saw little U.S. economic or military aid. However, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, all U.S. sanctions were removed, and Pakistan, having aligned with the U.S. in the war on terror, received substantial increases in both economic and military assistance.\n",
      "On June 16, 2009, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the Kerry-Lugar Bill. The bipartisan act authorized an annual provision of $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Pakistan, aimed at fostering enhanced bilateral relations.\n",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration suspended more than one-third of all military assistance, totaling approximately $800 million due to Osama bin Laden-related controversy. This reduction encompassed funds designated for military h...\n"
